  }
}

## Usage Examples

### Frontend Integration

#### 1. Display Available Plans
```javascript
// Get available plans
const response = await fetch('/api/v1/payments/plans', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
  }
});
const plans = await response.json();

// Display plans to user
plans.forEach(plan => {
  console.log(`${plan.name}: $${plan.price} for ${plan.credits} credits`);
});
```

#### 2. Create Checkout Session
```javascript
// Create checkout session
const response = await fetch('/api/v1/payments/checkout', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    plan_id: 1,
    success_url: 'https://your-app.com/success',
    cancel_url: 'https://your-app.com/cancel'
  })
});

const { checkout_url } = await response.json();

// Redirect to checkout
window.location.href = checkout_url;
```

#### 3. Handle Payment Success
```javascript
// On success page, check payment status
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const orderId = urlParams.get('order_id');

if (orderId) {
  // Payment was successful, credits should be added automatically
  // You can show a success message to the user
  showSuccessMessage('Payment successful! Credits have been added to your account.');
}
```

### Backend Integration

#### 1. Check User Credits
```python
from services.credit_service import CreditService

# Get user's current credit balance
balance = CreditService.get_balance(db, user_id)
print(f"User has {balance} credits")
```

#### 2. Process Refund
```python
from services.lemonsqueezy_service import LemonSqueezyService

# Create refund for a payment
refund = lemonsqueezy_service.create_refund(
    db=db,
    payment_id=123,
    amount=9.99,
    reason="Customer requested refund"
)
```

#### 3. Get Payment Analytics
```python
# Get payment statistics
stats = lemonsqueezy_service.get_user_payment_summary(db, user_id)
print(f"Total spent: ${stats['total_amount']}")
print(f"Total payments: {stats['total_payments']}")
```

## Webhook Processing

The system automatically processes LemonSqueezy webhooks for:

1. **Order Created**: Creates payment record
2. **Order Updated**: Updates payment status and adds credits

### Webhook Security

Webhooks are verified using HMAC-SHA256 signatures to ensure they come from LemonSqueezy.

## Error Handling

### Common Error Responses

```json
{
  "detail": "Plan not found or inactive"
}
```

```json
{
  "detail": "Payment must be completed to refund"
}
```

```json
{
  "detail": "Admin access required"
}
```

### Error Codes

- `400`: Bad Request (invalid data, plan not found, etc.)
- `401`: Unauthorized (invalid token)
- `403`: Forbidden (admin access required)
- `404`: Not Found (resource not found)
- `500`: Internal Server Error (webhook processing failed, etc.)

## Testing

### Test Mode

For testing, you can use LemonSqueezy's test mode:

1. Use test API keys
2. Create test products
3. Use test webhook endpoints
4. Test with test payment methods

### Sample Test Data

```json
{
  "plan_id": 1,
  "success_url": "http://localhost:3000/success",
  "cancel_url": "http://localhost:3000/cancel"
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Webhook Verification**: Always verify webhook signatures
2. **API Key Security**: Keep API keys secure and rotate regularly
3. **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS for all webhook endpoints
4. **Input Validation**: Validate all input data
5. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on payment endpoints

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Payment Success Rate**: Track successful vs failed payments
2. **Webhook Processing**: Monitor webhook processing success
3. **Credit Allocation**: Ensure credits are added correctly
4. **Refund Rate**: Track refund requests and processing
5. **Plan Performance**: Monitor which plans are most popular

### Logging

The system logs important events:
- Payment creation and updates
- Credit allocation
- Refund processing
- Webhook events
- Error conditions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Webhook Not Receiving Events**:
   - Check webhook URL is accessible
   - Verify webhook secret is correct
   - Check firewall/network settings

2. **Credits Not Added**:
   - Verify payment status is "completed"
   - Check webhook processing logs
   - Verify plan credits configuration

3. **Checkout Session Creation Fails**:
   - Verify API key is correct
   - Check plan is active
   - Verify variant ID exists

4. **Refund Processing Issues**:
   - Verify payment is completed
   - Check user has sufficient credits
   - Verify refund amount doesn't exceed payment amount

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting log level to DEBUG:

```python
import logging
logging.getLogger('services.lemonsqueezy_service').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

## Support

For issues with the payment integration:

1. Check the logs for error messages
2. Verify LemonSqueezy configuration
3. Test webhook endpoints
4. Contact support with detailed error information

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:

1. **Multiple Payment Gateways**: Support for Stripe, PayPal, etc.
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed payment analytics and reporting
3. **Automated Refunds**: Automatic refund processing based on rules
4. **Bulk Purchase Discounts**: Volume discounts for larger credit purchases
5. **Usage-Based Billing**: Pay-per-use instead of credit-based
6. **Multi-Currency Support**: Better support for multiple currencies
7. **Tax Calculation**: Automatic tax calculation and collection
